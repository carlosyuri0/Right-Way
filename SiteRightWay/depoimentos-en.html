I confess that it is a course that requires a lot of work haha, but it's worth it because it is a field where you can find a job practically anywhere, and even if it is not something you will work with for the rest of your life, it provides great experiences and a lot of learning.</p></h2>

                 <p>Hi, my name is Mariana, and I am currently studying graphic design. When I started the course at Univali, I was already working in the field, so I had some practical experience. However, it was in the course where I learned the theoretical aspects and concepts that would have taken me much longer to learn on my own. That's why I believe college is essential and made all the difference in my professional journey, aligning the day-to-day of the profession with the content taught by the teachers. Certain things cannot be found on the internet or in books.</p></h2>

                 <p>I am a pedagogue and completed a degree in Visual Arts at the IFTO campus in 2015. I often say that I have been passionate about art since I was very young, and it was an incredible experience to study it at IFTO. Over the years, I have been refining my skills, and I am very proud of my trajectory in Visual Arts. Knowledge has been gathered every day, and the course I took at IFTO was essential for that, as it allowed me to develop my academic perspective and aptitude for scientific research. I had the opportunity to develop a PIBIQ project, with the support of CNPq and IFTO, which I consider a turning point in my career.</p></h2>

It was one of the best experiences I've had in my life. I learned a lot academically, not only about Brazilian laws but also about many other countries' laws. I fell even more in love with the area, and studying there made me want to learn more and more about Law.</p></h2>
