                    <h3 class="titulo3">What is it? What is it for?</h3>
                    <p>The National High School Examination is today the main gateway to higher education in the
                        country.
                        Brazil. The test enables access to public and private educational institutions (being
                        criteria for winning scholarships and student funding from the federal government). O
                        result is also used for direct admission to universities that use the assessment of
                        integral form or as a complement to their own entrance exams for entry into their courses of
                        graduation. For having replaced the traditional entrance exam in thousands of colleges and
                        universities within the country and abroad - the Enem result is also accepted at universities
                        Portuguese - has become part of the school calendar for students who are completing
                        high school and other Brazilians who wish to enter higher education. </p>

                    <h3 class="titulo3">When was it created?</h3>
                    <p>The first Enem test was applied in 1998 with the aim of evaluating students who
                        completed the last stage of basic training. Over the years some changes have taken place.
                        in the application of the exam and, currently, it is the most important and awaited test by
                        students
                        Brazilians who wish to enter higher education.</p>

                    <h3 class="titulo3">Who can participate?</h3>
                    <p>Despite being an important test and already known by many, some people still have doubts about
                        it.
                        regarding who can take the Enem. Anyone who has completed high school can participate.
                        of the exam, as well as students who are about to complete it.</p>

                    <h3 class="titulo3">Is it possible to obtain a high school diploma with Enem?</h3>
                    <p>No. Until 2016, Enem was also used to obtain high school diplomas,
                        however, as of the 2017 edition, the exam no longer has this purpose. Young people
                        interested in obtaining the certification will have to take the National Examination of
                        Youth and Adult Skills Certification. Learn more about the Encceja exam
                        for high school.</p>
